# rpg-heroes

This repository contains a Diablo 2 inspired project in which four different classes can be created, Mage, Rogue, Ranger, and Warrior. Each class inherits from an abstract Hero class, and they all have their own functionality based on the classes. They have the hero attributes strength, dexterity, and intelligence, and each class benefits differently from the attributes. The heroes can equip both armor and weapons, and what the hero can equip is based on the class of the hero. A mage can, for example, equip cloth armor, and use staffs and wands as weapon. 

The code has gone through unit testing and the test report can be found in the repository.
